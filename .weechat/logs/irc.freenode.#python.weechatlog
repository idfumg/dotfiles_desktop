Just do clear some things out, data encapsulation deals with more than just hiding the variable from the user (to which point I agree, in python hiding this is a lost cause) but DE handles hiding internal workings of a class from the user as well. I.e. take a class ellipsoid, I'd probably define it over major and minor axis but would expose eccentricity, area, circumference to the user as a property for
2015-12-28 19:43:29	ljetibo	sure, and through getters and setters I'd assure myself when the user is messing with one of the parameters the basic a&b are being recalculated so that no "weirdness" appears when it comes to numbers. I don't see this hiding of how internals work as a bad thing at all...

2015-12-28 19:58:08	simpson	Java/C# has POJO and the idea of polite namespace access. C++ is memory-unsafe, of course. And Python...Python is very much about mutually consenting objects.

But I'd represent to the user over property as if I've actually calculated all other parameters of the elipse (such as focus points, eccentricity, area etc...)
